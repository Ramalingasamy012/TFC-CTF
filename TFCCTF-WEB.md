# TFC CTF
## CALENDAR - WEB (Medium)
### Description
Are online calendars trusty?
Note: The website displays "Error establishing a database connection" at startup. Please wait ~10 seconds and refresh
The flag is format :TFCCTF{FOUNDPASSWORD}

### Solution

On visiting the challenge url,it was the simple website which was using wordpress.
So, i started searching about wordpress CVE's based on calenders.We ended up with this <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50084">CVE</a>

Here, what is the vulnerability is , It did not properly restrict access to the export files,
allowing unauthenticated users to exports all events data in CSV or XML format.

Using this exported CSV file, we can able to find username and password. And the password is the FLAG!!!

## PONG - WEB (WARMUP)
### Description
Some random website that can ping hosts.

### Solution

It was the easy command injection challenge.

#### payload

## Diamonds - WEB (MEDIUM)
### Description
Write something nice that passes our filter.

The webpage shows only one input box which can allow to enter only alphabets and numbers.

If we enter anything other than this it shows like `That is far away from nice !! `
So,here we have to bypass the regex which were written on the server side.

`There were a lot of payloads online on SSTI . But before that can be passed through to read the flag.txt file. After a time of research,Knowing that the regex can be bypassed with newlines, we can start looking for an exploit to read flag.txt `

### Solution 

<%= File.open('flag.txt').read %>
 But we need to url encode this payload
